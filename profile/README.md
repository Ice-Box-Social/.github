## Hi there 👋

🙋‍♀️  It is Ice Box.

Our app allows users to create their stickers-nft in various L2 networks. The sticker can be different colors, have one of the stamps, and contain a fenced message for each user. 
All created NFTs stay in the user's wallet. Our fridge is just an exhibition of these creations. 

Our app is designed and drawn by our designers using Figma. The contracts were created on Solidity in partner networks.
Implemented using JavaScript, Polybase and FVM.
